The code for my agent can be found in mdpAgents.py

To run my agent use the following command:
python pacman.py -q -p MDPAgent -l mediumClassic

To run the AI multiple times add the following flag:
-n [number of runs]

A list of other layouts you can replace mediumClassic with can be found in the layouts folder however the aim of the task was to produce
an algorithm which would be most effective for mediumClassic

The testing of my algorithm and in-depth explanation of my code can be found in my report (Report.pdf)
